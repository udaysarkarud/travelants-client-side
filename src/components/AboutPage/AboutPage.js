                        <p>The continually increase in the numbers of big cats in Madhya Pradesh is only doubling tourist interest upon the state.The forest Ministry stated that this particular move has been made solely as a slow initiative to start tourism activities in these areas because in the past, these reserves and parks were a major player in Madhya Pradesh Tourism.The key element here is that there visitors will only be allowed to enter following the right Covid restrictions</p>

                        <p>During the second wave of Covid-19, Tiger reserves and National Parks had remained closed in April and May, as a precautionary measure.However, forest Minister Vijay Shah recently announced that the national parks and tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh will remain open from June 1 to June 30.Tiger reserves like Bandhavgarh, Kanha, Satpura, Pench, and Panna are going to stay open all June.Another cause of celebration that the tiger reserves in Madhya Pradesh have is that, with a population of 526 tigers, it re-achieved the top slot in the 2018 census. They showed the maximum number of tigers (3,421) which was followed by Karnataka (1,783) and then Maharashtra (1,690). Forest officials have also spotted 41 new tiger cubs at Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve.</p>
